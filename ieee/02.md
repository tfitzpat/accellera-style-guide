Easy-to-use guidance on writing the draft is available on the IEEE SA website [https://standards.ieee.org/develop/drafting-standard/index.html](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/drafting-standard/index.html).

Those who are new to the IEEE SA standards development process, or who want to ensure that best practices are being followed, should consider enrolling in IEEE SA’s free Working Group Chair Fundamentals course, available on the IEEE Learning Network
([https://iln.ieee.org/public/TrainingCatalog.aspx](https://iln.ieee.org/public/TrainingCatalog.aspx)). Editorial information is covered in Module 9, “The Editorial Process” and Module 11, “Final Approval and Publication.”
