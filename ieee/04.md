# Responsibilities of the standards committee

For information on IEEE standards draft requirements, please refer to the *IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual*. The general responsibilities and duties of the standards committee of each project are delineated in [5.1.1](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect5.html) and [5.1.2](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect5.html) of the *IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual*.

If there is a conflict between the *IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual* and this manual, the *IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual* takes precedence.
