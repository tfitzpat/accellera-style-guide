# Standard language i.e., shall, should, may, and can

Mandatory requirements set within an IEEE standard are clearly distinguished by using specific standard verbs—specifically, shall, should, may, and can.

*Shall*, *should*, *may*, and *can* are defined in [6.4.7](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect6.html) of the *IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual*.

The word *shall* indicates mandatory requirements strictly to be followed in order to conform to the standard and from which no deviation is permitted (*shall* equals *is required to*).

> Note that the word *must* is deprecated and shall not be used when stating mandatory requirements; *must* is used only to describe unavoidable situations. The word *will* is deprecated and shall not be used when stating mandatory requirements; *will* is only used in statements of fact.

The word *should* indicates that among several possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required (*should* equals *is recommended that*).

The word *may* is used to indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the standard (*may* equals *is permitted to*).

The word *can* is used for statements of possibility and capability, whether material, physical, or causal (*can* equals *is able to*).
