# Introduction

The Accellera Style Guide defines the recommended structure, formatting and style to develop and publish Accellera (Draft) Standards, User Guides and other standard-related documentation. This style guide serves as a reference for Accellera working groups in the technical editing process when drafting a standard-related document.

The Accellera Style Guide is compatible with the IEEE SA Standards Style Manual, such that Accellera standards can be transferred to the IEEE Standardization Association, without the need to make fundamental changes to a document.
Note that the Accellera Style Guide defines additional guidelines which are not explicitly documented in the IEEE SA Standards Style Manual, to ease the creation of Accellera and IEEE standard compatible documents.

The Accellera Style Guide is owned and maintained by the Accellera Technical Committee. Working groups are encouraged to report findings and issues when using this style guide to the Accellera Technical Committee chair, such that improvements and learnings can be incorporated in this guide.

The Accellera Technical Committee also offers a documentation flow which is provided by [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com/). This documentation flow uses the Markdown format for authoring, and offers documentation generation to render the standard document in the required style.
