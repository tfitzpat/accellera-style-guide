# 1. Overview

This manual establishes preferred style for the presentation and structure of proposed IEEE standards (drafts).

It is strongly recommended that working groups consult with IEEE SA content publishing staff before deviating from the style outlined in this manual. Failure to follow the recommendations of this manual may result in delayed approval of the draft standard by the IEEE SA Standards Board or in delayed publication.

This manual is not intended to be a guide to the procedural development of a standard.[^standard] For that, consult the [*IEEE SA Standards Board Bylaws*](http://standards.ieee.org/about/policies/bylaws/index.html) and the [*IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual*](http://standards.ieee.org/about/policies/opman/).[^manual]


[^standard]: While this manual uses the term “standard,” its rules apply generically to guides and recommended practices as well.

[^manual]: IEEE Standards manuals are available on the IEEE Standards website ([http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies)). Users are encouraged to visit this site for the most up-to-date information.
