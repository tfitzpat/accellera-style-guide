# 7. Trademarks

Working groups shall research the proper usage guidelines for any trademarks appropriate for their drafts and ensure that no fees are required, limitations imposed, etc. This information is usually stated on the websites of the trademark owners. If used, any trademarked items shall be identified in the standard and marked as such (with either ® or ™), as appropriate, upon first reference. All trademarked items cited in standards shall be credited to the trademark owner in the frontmatter of the standard. Note that there are restrictions on trademark use. See [Clause 8](08.html).

IEEE designations are trademarks of the IEEE and shall be identified as trademarks (® or ™, as appropriate) at first citation of each designation in the frontmatter and in the body of the draft.
