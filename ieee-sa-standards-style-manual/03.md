# 3. Using IEEE SA templates to write the draft

IEEE drafts should be developed using IEEE SA templates, currently available in Adobe® FrameMaker® and Microsoft® Word.[^adobe2]<sup>,</sup> [^word2] IEEE SA templates and supporting documentation are available from the [IEEE Standards website](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/stdswritten.html). Questions about using IEEE SA templates can be sent to [sa_templates@ieee.org](mailto:sa_templates@ieee.org).

In addition to expediting document creation, the MS Word template easily enables line numbering. If used, line numbers should appear in the margins of the first page and should appear in the margins of each subsequent page. If using a software program other than MS Word or Adobe FrameMaker, please contact IEEE SA content publishing staff as early as possible in the development process.
