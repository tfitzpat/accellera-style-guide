# Introduction

The IEEE Standards Style Manual (PDF) establishes preferred style for the preparation and structure of proposed IEEE standards (drafts). It also cites requirements of the *IEEE SA Standards Board Operations Manual* that are related to the development and publication of IEEE standards.

The standards committee of an IEEE Standards project is responsible for providing the IEEE SA Standards Board with a complete, technically accurate draft of the standard, and this manual serves as a reference for working groups during the IEEE standards development lifecycle, particularly when drafting the standard.

IEEE SA also provides useful templates available in Adobe® FrameMaker® or Microsoft® Word.[^adobe]<sup>, </sup>[^microsoft] The styles and format are built into the templates, which help reduce IEEE post-approval production time.
