Citation of a product, service, or company shall be avoided. In those cases, where a sole source exists, the product, service, or company shall be described generically in text and the product, service or company supplied in a footnote accompanying the text, as follows:

> At the time of this publication [product, service, or company] was an example of [name of generic product, etc.]. This information is given for the convenience of users of this standard and does not constitute an endorsement by the IEEE of these products. Equivalent products may be used if they can be shown to lead to the same results.

If every effort has been made to substitute a generic word or phrase in text for the product, service, or company, but no suitable substitute can be found, add the following footnote to accompany the citation:

> This information is given for the convenience of users of this standard and does not constitute an endorsement by the IEEE of these products. Equivalent products may be used if they can be shown to lead to the same results.

In addition to the above footnote, within the text add “or the equivalent” after the name of the product, service or company. For example,

> “…use an ABC, or the equivalent, to monitor…”
