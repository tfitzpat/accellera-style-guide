# Annex A **(normative)** Guidelines and best practices for the creation and maintenance of IEEE standards terms and definitions

## A.1 The IEEE Standards Dictionary Online

All terms defined in approved IEEE standards are automatically included in the *IEEE Standards Dictionary Online*, which is updated on a regular basis.

Any terms that working groups, committees, or societies/standards committees use within their group that are intended for inclusion in the *IEEE Standards Dictionary Online* must be written into drafts that go for ballot and IEEE SA Standards Board approval.

The *IEEE Standards Dictionary Online* is available at [http://dictionary.ieee.org](http://dictionary.ieee.org). An IEEE Account is required for access to the dictionary, and one can be created at no charge on the dictionary sign-in page.

## A.2 Creation of new terms and definitions

The following guidelines should be followed when creating new terms and definitions:

1. New terms and definitions included in IEEE standards should be written in plain English using clear and concise descriptions. Terms themselves should not be used in their own definitions.
2. Needless customization should be avoided so that definitions have as broad an application as appropriate. Definitions that are too specific should be avoided.
3. New definitions that serve to add a new definition to an existing term(s) of the same name should be different enough from the other term(s) so as to justify the addition. Having more than two or three acceptable definitions for any term is discouraged.
4. Terms and definitions that are included in IEEE standards but that are taken from other sources must be accompanied by an appropriate permission acknowledgment. The sources should be identified in a parenthetical statement that immediately follows the term/definition.
5. Supplemental material that accompanies a term for clarification but is not an official part of the actual definition should be included either in the body of the document or in a note that immediately follows the term/definition. Definitions should not include references to other clauses/subclauses in the standard.
6. Definitions should have no commercial connotations and should be completely non-proprietary.
7. Symbols should be defined as appropriate.
8. Acronyms and abbreviations should be included in a separate subclause.

Suggestions for oversight (at the working group, committee, or society/standards committee level):

* It is recommended that every standards-developing society/standards committee have a definitions group of some kind. If a society has multiple groups (whether at the committee or working group levels), there should be one ruling group responsible for making ultimate decisions and resolving any differences.
* Working groups should be advised to ask themselves to technically justify new terms and their definitions before proposing them.
* New terms and definitions should be examined in consideration of: subject matter; existing terms in the *IEEE Standards Dictionary Online* and general-usage dictionaries; usage within other IEEE societies/IEEE SA committees; comparable international terms; usage in relevant literature; etc.
* The creation of new terms can be time consuming and may take place either before or after working group meetings and may take place in a subgroup before presenting to the working group.

## A.3 Revision of existing terms and definitions

The following guidelines should be followed when revising existing terms and definitions:

1. Because all terms, including revised terms, must be seen and approved by balloters, all existing terms that require revision should be included in revision drafts. A note indicating that the term is being revised may be appropriate.
2. Groups should revise terms only if necessary. Previously published terms and definitions should not be changed due to possible widespread use in other standards. Revisions for minor or editorial changes is discouraged.

Suggestions for oversight (at the working group, committee, or society/standards committee level):

* Societies may appoint the task of revising terms to the same group responsible for the general oversight of the creation of terms and definitions.
* If the revision of an existing term is being done to include requirements of other societies, etc., communication should take place first with members of the definitions-review teams within those other groups so as to consider relevant factors.

## A.4 International harmonization

For IEEE standards that are, might be, or will be used in the international arena, it is suggested that the text of the definitions also be included in the text of the standards themselves.

In some cases, if a particular IEEE definition is preferred over a definition used elsewhere in the international arena, this should be indicated.

Special attention should be given to definitions intended to be included in dual logo documents.

Suggestion for oversight (at the working group, committee, or standards committee level):

* When creating terms/definitions for international projects, it is appropriate to research any international requirements/differences.
* Questions regarding style for international projects should be directed to the IEEE SA content publishing staff.
