# 6. Patents

Working groups concerned about or interested in the relationship of patents and patent-related requirements to IEEE standards should review the IEEE SA Standards Board [Patent Committee website](https://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/materials.html). Please note that any reference to patents or patent applications shall be made only in the frontmatter of the standard. The [IEEE SA templates](https://standards.ieee.org/develop/drafting-standard/resources.html) contain the patent statement that is to be included in the frontmatter.
