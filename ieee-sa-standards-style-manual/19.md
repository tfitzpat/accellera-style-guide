# 19. Bibliography

## 19.1 General

The bibliography shall always be an informative lettered annex that appears as either the first or last annex of the standard. See Annex B for an example.

If bibliographic items are cited in text, tables, figures, or notes, the citation should be placed at the point where reference is made to them. If the item is a standard, the designation (e.g., IEEE Std 1226.6-1996) and bibliographic reference number (e.g., [B4]) should be cited. If the reference is to an article, book, or other type of publication included in the bibliography, the title or author of the publication and the bibliographic reference number should be cited.

The bibliography should be ordered alphanumerically, without respect to the type of publication being cited.

## 19.2 Citing standards in a bibliography

Standards listed shall include designation and title. They can be either dated or undated, whichever is appropriate to a particular entry.

*Example:*

\[B1] ASME BPVC-I-2004, Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section 1—Power Boilers.

\[B2] Code of Federal Regulations Title 29 Part 1210 Section 354 (29CFR1210.354), Health and Safety Standards—Head injury.

\[B3] ISO/IEC 7498-4, Information processing systems—Open Systems Interconnection—Basic Reference Model—Part 4: Management framework.

## 19.3 Articles in periodicals

Consult *The Chicago Manual of Style*, current edition, for detailed information on how to list periodicals.

Articles listed shall include the following information in the order shown:

1. Last name of author or authors and first name or initials, or name of organization
2. Title of article in quotation marks
3. Title of periodical in full and set in italics
4. Volume, number, and, if available, part
5. First and last pages of article
6. Date of issue

*Example:*

## 19.4 Books

Consult the current *The Chicago Manual of Style* for detailed information on how to list books.

Books listed shall include the following information in the order shown:

1. Last name of author or authors and first name or initials, or name of organization. Note that for a book with two or more authors, only the first-listed name is inverted in the bibliography entry.
2. Title of book (in italics)
3. Edition number (if applicable)
4. Place of publication (city)
5. Name of publisher
6. Year of publication
7. First and last page of reference
